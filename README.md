# Hi 👋, I'm Muaz Ahmed

**CS Senior @ FAST NUCES | ML Engineer | Building AI-Powered Solutions**

Currently working on intelligent systems that bridge NLP and real-world applications—from meeting intelligence platforms to autonomous project management tools.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

**ScrumMate** - My Final Year Project  
An autonomous scrum master assistant that transcribes meetings, generates user stories, and creates sprint-ready tasks with dependency mapping. Built with PyTorch, Whisper, LangGraph, and ChromaDB.

**Meeting Intelligence Platform** - ML Internship @ Genesys Research Lab  
Developed an end-to-end offline-first solution for Pakistani enterprises featuring real-time Urdu-English transcription, speaker diarization, and LangChain agentic workflows. Optimized Whisper for code-switching scenarios—achieved 92% faster inference with only 6% quality loss.

## 🔬 Recent Projects

- **Legal Document Summarization System** - Complete NLP pipeline with custom CBOW embeddings, extractive/abstractive summarization, and semantic search for legal documents
- **VibeQ** - Semantic music search engine using transformer embeddings and vector search across 1000+ songs (deployed on HuggingFace)

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C/C++, JavaScript, Java  
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers, LangChain, Whisper, OpenCV, spaCy  
**Tools:** Docker, Git, CUDA, FastAPI  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ChromaDB, FAISS

## 🎯 Currently Exploring

- RAG architectures for conversational data
- Optimizing LLMs for low-resource environments
- Agentic workflows with LangGraph
